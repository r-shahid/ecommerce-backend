## Project Description

Welcome to impulse shopping. This is a web application where both consumer and vendors come together to buy and sell the products they want! With impulse, users can browse through whatever products they desire, check on more details on the product, add it to cart and be able to checkout. The consumer user can also be able to look at their past orders and reviews of the product they are looking at. Posts are made by sellers to add on products page.
